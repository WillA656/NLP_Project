**INTRODUCTION**

This report seeks to determine whether or not there exists a statistically significant difference in the subject and object frequencies for feminine and masculine personal pronouns. To begin with, we had to determine what corpus of text to perform our analysis on. We decided to use the top ten most popular fantasy novels from Project Gutenberg. We felt that this was the best source of data as it was easy to access and came to us as simple text files. We felt that a larger corpus was necessary to have more statistically valid conclusions, and that ten novels would be a sufficient amount of text.

**HYPOTHESIS**
--Introduce hypothesis

--Explain how we'll know if hypothesis is supported (if necessary)

**METHODOLOGY**
--How are we defining statistical significance?
--How did we assemble the corpus?
--How did we analyze the data?
--Results of our analysis

**EVALUATION**
--Explain results
--Assess hypothesis validity
